Trump stated that about 10 or 12 letters would go out on Friday, with additional letters coming over the next few days, and that countries would be fully covered by July 9.

Trump said that tariffs would range in value from 60 or 70% to 10 and 20%, and that countries would "start to pay on August 1" with the money going to the United States.
