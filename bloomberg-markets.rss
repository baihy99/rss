New Jersey Transit locomotive engineers went on strike early Friday, shutting down the agency's rail service and disrupting travel for hundreds of thousands of commuters.
The strike, the first in over 40 years, is a result of failed contract negotiations between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen over a wage increase, with the union seeking parity with engineers at other major US railroads.
The shutdown has forced riders to find alternative modes of transportation, with buses and light-rail service continuing to operate, and officials warning of a funding crisis for transit agencies across the country.
