The Islamic Republic fired another missile against Israel on Monday, while Israeli forces kept up strikes on Iranian military sites and airports. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged in a news conference to continue Israel’s military campaign in Iran. Tehran has yet to announce whether or how it might strike American targets in the Middle East. President Donald Trump’s decision to deploy bunker-busting bombs and cruise missiles on the country’s three main nuclear sites on Sunday pushed the Middle East into uncharted territory.

Such a move, however, could not proceed without the approval of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Authorities may yet restrict flows in other ways.

The US State Department issued a “Worldwide Caution” alert for American citizens, flagging the potential of travel disruptions. “The conflict between Israel and Iran has resulted in disruptions to travel and periodic closure of airspace across the Middle East,” the State Department said in a statement.
