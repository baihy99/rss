The Israeli prime minister also said the country will respond forcefully to any breach of the truce, and that its objectives had been achieved. An Iranian official also confirmed Tehran had agreed to the cessation of fighting, Reuters reported. 

Oil futures tumbled more than 5%, dropping below $68 a barrel, as Israel said it had agreed to the move. The plunge &mdash; which followed a roller-coaster session on Monday that ended in steep losses &mdash; took prices below the level on June 12, the day before Israel attacked Iran.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.
