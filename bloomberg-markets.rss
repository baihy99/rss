Yes, the US Navy and Air Force Special Operations decided to accept the mission: help Cruise’s secret agent Ethan Hunt save the world. Or, at least make a movie about it.
For Paramount Global’s The Final Reckoning, released Friday in the US, Cruise and the crew spent three days in the Adriatic Sea filming aboard the USS George H.W. Bush, a nuclear powered Nimitz-class carrier commissioned in 2009. 
It’s the latest cinematic incarnation of Cruise’s career-long affinity for the US military and its aircraft (as well as doing his own stunts). It’s also an example of the Pentagon’s willingness to showcase its hardware and martial might through a classic piece of American soft power, the Hollywood blockbuster.
