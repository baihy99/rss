Trump said he would extend the deadline for the European Union to face 50% tariffs until July 9 after a phone call with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The EU had been slated for a 20% tariff under those reciprocal rates announced in April, and a temporary pause took the rate down to 10%.
