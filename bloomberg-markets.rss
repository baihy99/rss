The retailer said it generated earnings per share of $4.28 for the quarter ended May 11, above what Wall Street analysts were expecting. The metric suggests that Costco is growing its business even as consumers prioritize necessities to save money.

Burt Flickinger, Managing Director of Strategic Resource Group, reacts to Costco's earnings and examines the health of other key players in the retail sector, including Walmart, The Gap and Ulta Beauty. Burt speaks with Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily.
