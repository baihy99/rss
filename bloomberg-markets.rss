Powell’s term as chair ends in May 2026. In Brussels, EU leaders are meeting to discuss fresh sanctions on Russia, US tariffs and their response to the Middle East conflicts.

The moves followed a Wall Street Journal report that Trump may announce Jerome Powell’s replacement as soon as September, an unusually early appointment.

The Fed unveiled plans to roll back an important capital rule that big banks have said limits their ability to hold more Treasuries and Shell said it has no intention of making a takeover offer for BP refuting an earlier report that two of Europe’s biggest companies were in active merger talks.

The Opening Trade has everything you need to know as markets open across Europe. With analysis you won't find anywhere else, we break down the biggest stories of the day and speak to top guests who have skin in the game. Hosted by Anna Edwards, Guy Johnson and Kriti Gupta.
