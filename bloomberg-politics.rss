Today's election is a closely contested race between Nawrocki and Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw who is supported by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The election is seen as a test of whether the government, with its centrist parliamentary coalition, can overcome the right-wing populism embodied by PiS.
