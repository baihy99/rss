The eatery's co-owner, Renee Pasquarella, said the cost for everything needed to run the business — from cardboard boxes to pizza ingredients including cheese, tomatoes, meat — has gone up. She said that in the 67 years the pizza place has been serving customers this has been one of the toughest times to keep it open. The Labor Department released a report indicating that the consumer price index rose 7 percent in December, compared to a year ago, the fastest increase since June 1982.
